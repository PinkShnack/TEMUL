==================
Analysis Workflows
==================

The TEMUL Toolkit contains some basic analysis workflows for the various
ferroelectric material-types described in
:ref:`Finding Polarisation Vectors <polarisation_vectors_tutorial>`.

The python scripts, jupyter notebooks and data can be downloaded from the 
`TEMUL repository <https://github.com/PinkShnack/TEMUL>`_ in the 
"code_tutorials/workflows" folder.

You can also interact with the data without needing any downloads.
Just click the button below and navigate to that same folder,
where you will find the python scripts and interactive python notebooks:

More will be added to these workflows in future. If you have any ideas, please
create an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/PinkShnack/TEMUL/issues>`_ or 
create a pull request.
