**02/11/2020: Version 0.1.1 released**

This version contains many changes to the TEMUL Toolkit.

    * More parameters have been added to the polarisation module's :python:`plot_polarisation_vectors` function. Check out the walkthrough :ref:`here <polarisation_vectors_tutorial>` for more info!
    * :ref:`Interactive double Gaussian filtering <dg_visualiser_tutorial>` with the :python:`visualise_dg_filter` function in the signal_processing module. Thanks to `Michael Hennessy <https://github.com/michaelhennessyjr>`_ for the help!
    * The :python:`calculate_atom_plane_curvature` function has been added, creating the lattice_structure_tools module.
    * Strain, rotation, and c/a mapping can now be done :ref:`here <structure_map_tutorial>`.
    * Masked FFT filtering to obtain iFFTs. See :ref:`this guide <masked_fft_tutorial>` to see some code!
    * Example walk-throughs for many features of the TEMUL Toolkit are now on this website! Check out the menu on the left to get started!
